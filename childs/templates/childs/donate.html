        <p>Whether you decide to make a one-off donation or to sponsor a child we promise that the donation you make today will be used to
             keep a child at school or to keep their families safe and warm by addressing their urgent needs. We recommend you to
              <a href="{% url 'accounts:user_login' %}">Register / Log in</a> before making your donation which enables you to manage your donations 
              and helps us keep track of our donors and available funds. However, it is also possible to donate anonymously without registering/logging in, if you wish to do so.</p>
        <p>Regardless, your donation will change the lives of extremely vulnerable children in under developed countries. It satisfies their 
            urgent needs and helps them gain access to education and/or enables them to remain in school. Unlike other charities 100% of your
             donations will go to children in need. As a small charity we are volunteer based and have no overheads.</p>
